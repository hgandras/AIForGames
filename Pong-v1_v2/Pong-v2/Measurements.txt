Number of A* iterations per second. For this test I advanced the model, and used the reactive agent as player2.

TimeIt[PongEngine] 1000000 iterations in => total: 838.0926s, avg: 0.0008380926s
TimeIt[PongEngine] in 0.05s we managed to run 56 iterations

I am not using the dynamic state, but a Node class that I am cloning, and I measured its cloning speed.

TimeIt[DynamicState.Clone] 1000000 iterations in => total: 0.4884831s, avg: 4.884831E-07s
TimeIt[DynamicState.Clone] in 0.05s we managed to run 103674 iterations
